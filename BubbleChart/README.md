###Creating a Bubble Chart
D3 provides several [layouts](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Layouts) that can be used to display data.  Let's work through creating a Bubble Chart using the [Pack](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Pack-Layout) layout. As always the most practical and tangible way to learn how to build any chart is to use a real world example.  This tutorial will use the following [json data](/random-thoughts.json) pulled from the [Random Thoughts](http://randomthoughts.link/) web site created by my friend Alex Deschamps midway through our 3 month Immersive Web Development class at GA.  He knew I had been studying D3 since the class started and after a few short discussions we agreed that the sites "cool" factor could be extended by incorporating some D3 data visualization.
